# RickRollBot
 
Uses a webcrawler to find popular videos and pictures from `source pending` to either splice or overlay some background music which then cuts abruptly into a Rick Astley clip hence "Rick Rolling" the viewer. These new videos will then be uploaded to Instagram as a bot account by the tag [@definitely_not_rick_astley](https://www.instagram.com/definitely_not_rick_astley/).
